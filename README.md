# Stack

Full-stack boilerplate for _fun_\* website applications.

\* If your website application is not _fun_, you are not allowed to use this.

- `server/`: Python/Flask back-end using PostgreSQL as a database.
- `client/`: NodeJS/SvelteKit front-end.

## Usage

- Download the repository and rename it to your app.

```
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:beanpuppy/stack.git myapp
```

- Do `README` instructions in `server/` and `client/`.

Once you're setup, read the documents in `docs/` to get an understanding of what's actually here (and why).
