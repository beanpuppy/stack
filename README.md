# Stack

Full-stack boilerplate for *fun\** website applications.

* `server/`: Python/Flask back-end using PostgreSQL as a database.
* `client/`: SvelteKit front-end.

## Usage

* Download the repository and rename to your app.

```
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:beanpuppy/stack.git myapp
```

* Do `README` instructions in `server/` and `client/`.

\* If your website application is not *fun*, you are not allowed to use this.
